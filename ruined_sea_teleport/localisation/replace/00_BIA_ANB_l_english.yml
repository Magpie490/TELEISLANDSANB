 orthodox_flavor.1.d:0 "The Church is a large landowner and this has brought a great deal of wealth to the Church. The non-possessors claim that the Church is being corrupted by this great wealth. Their opponents argue that the Church needs this wealth to carry out its holy mission. The key thing is the Church isn't really a big taxpayer, if it was forced to give its land away it would move it into the hands of people we can tax. The downside would be the Church would have less wealth to perform its mission."

Our patriarch is proposing some reforms to our liturgy that will bring our form closer to the other churches. The idea is bold and will strengthen the Church but we know that the superstitious and backward will reject this change."

 orthodox_flavor.4.t:0 "Reduce the Independence of the Church"
 orthodox_flavor.4.d:0 "The Church is a powerful institution, but more important a wealthy one. If we were to rein in the Church and make more a part of the state we would also bring in more income for taxation. On the other hand we would also sap its authority in the eyes of the masses."

 catholic_flavor.1.t:0 "The Council of $PROVINCECAPITAL$"
 catholic_flavor.1.d:0 "His Holiness, the Pope, has tasked a commission of cardinals with addressing the challenges posed by the Protestant movement. While the Catholic faith itself must not be compromised, His Holiness and most cardinals are willing to admit that some Protestant complaints are valid. Therefore, the Council advises many changes to the administration of the Church, a stop to absentee Bishops and the worldly excesses of the clergy. In addition, several new monastic orders are to be founded, to aid in the efforts of the Counter-Reformation."
 catholic_flavor.1.a:0 "About Time!"
 catholic_flavor.2.t:0 "The Kingdom of God on Earth"
 catholic_flavor.2.d:0 "Having united the whole of Italy under the banner of Catholicism, the Pope has seen fit to declare it 'The Kingdom of God'. Catholics from all over Europe flock to his banner, eager to live in this model nation of Christian virtue. Foreign powers can no longer control the College of Cardinals, but neither will they pay much heed to any Papal bulls or decrees."
 catholic_flavor.2.a:1 "All Men under one God!"
 catholic_flavor.2.b:0 "Amen"
 catholic_flavor.3.t:0 "The Pentarchy"
 catholic_flavor.3.d:1 "Having brought all five Patriarchates back into the Christian - Orthodox - fold, we have restored the old Pentarchy, thus effectively ending the great East-West Schism. While some countries might continue to cling to Catholicism, the Pope has lost his vaunted primacy as the lawful successor of St Peter and Bishop of Rome."

 catholic_flavor.4.t:0 "Simony?"
 catholic_flavor.4.d:0 "We have a vacancy in high position in the church administration of $CAPITAL$. There is a churchman from a rich family who has made an offer. If we approve and back his election to the position, we will gain a large contribution to our coffers. Some more devout people claim that this is a sin called Simony, but what do they know?"
 catholic_flavor.4.a:0 "We need the money!"
 catholic_flavor.4.b:0 "It is a sin!"
 catholic_flavor.5.t:0 "Selling of Indulgences"
 catholic_flavor.5.d:2 "'As soon as a coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory springs!', in the words of Johann Tetzel, a Dominican friar who has made it his mission to collect indulgences for the Pope. Promising absolution from earthly sins in return for money, he has been highly active in saving the souls of the rich - and that, in a way that doesn't even require them to give up their vices! However, this practice has raised eyebrows among the [Root.GetAdjective] clergy, who are uncomfortable with the idea that the Pope should enrich himself in such a manner. Instead, they call for Christians to show true repentence if their sins are to be forgiven.\n\nAs [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] grows older, the disputes on the matter grow more personal. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] has sinned, as every [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must to keep their rule secure. How best should [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] acquire forgiveness?"
 catholic_flavor.5.a:1 "A donation to the Pope shall be arranged."
 catholic_flavor.5.b:1 "Indulgences are the easy option; repentence is better."
 catholic_flavor.6.t:0 "Veneration of Relics"
 catholic_flavor.6.d:1 "From the highest to the very low, the people believe that the veneration of will allows the viewer to reduce their time in purgatory. A treatise opposing this practice has been found nailed to the door of one of our churches in [unrest_province.GetName] that has a very substantial relic collection. Is there any truth in their complaints, or are they merely naysayers and heretics seeking to harm the unity of church, our one true path to salvation?"
 catholic_flavor.6.a:0 "But I just bought a vial of the milk of the Virgin Mary."
 catholic_flavor.6.b:0 "Forgiveness can only come from God."
 catholic_flavor.7.t:1 "Veneration of the Virgin Mary"
 catholic_flavor.7.d:0 "The Blessed Virgin Mary, mother of our Lord Jesus Christ, is the Queen of heaven and mediator of many graces. There is no more perfect woman and her holy motherhood grants her a seat at the right hand of God. Or does it? Recently, radical theologians have been arguing that there is no need for such intercessions. Are they right, or is the holy mother church in danger from their almost heretical utterings?"
 catholic_flavor.7.a:0 "May the Madonna forgive them."
 catholic_flavor.7.b:0 "She is a special woman, but still just a woman."
 catholic_flavor.8.t:0 "The Doctrine of Particular Judgment"
 catholic_flavor.8.d:1 "As we know, when we die, God judges immediately and decides a soul's fate until it awaits the last judgment. However, a monk has started a doctrinal dispute that verges on the edge of heresy, claiming that there is no purgatory and saying that prayers for the dead do not assist their passage into heaven. These disputes are threatening the very unity of our church."
 catholic_flavor.8.a:0 "He is probably a heretic."
 catholic_flavor.8.b:0 "Sorry, there is nothing you can do for your dead loved ones."
 catholic_flavor.9.t:0 "A New Confession of Faith"
 catholic_flavor.9.d:0 "Reformers have put forward a new confession of faith that has some minor, but still serious, differences with Catholic teachings. The church claims it borders on the heretical, while there are those who suggest it would bring the Church and its administrative apparatus under tighter control."
 catholic_flavor.9.a:0 "Promote it."
 catholic_flavor.9.b:0 "Nay, it will damn everyone."
 catholic_flavor.10.t:0 "A Promise of Safe Passage?"
 catholic_flavor.10.d:0 "One of the so called reforming monks has recently appeared at our court under our most solemn promise of safe passage to argue the justness of his cause. Like Hus before him, his heresy is manifest but our word has been given."
 catholic_flavor.10.a:0 "Our honor is our word."

As the city itself was under occupation his sorrow was shared by many of his [Root.GetAdjective] brethren. The very next day it was as if the icon had heard his prayers. The loyal people of [eleusa_church_province.GetName] rose as one and evicted the remaining enemy forces.\nThe continued fortunes of the province seem unclear but as war and devastation haunt the [Root.GetAdjective] countryside many of our citizens are turning to the church for consolation and moral support."

 orthodox_icon_events.3.d:0 "A recent recruitment campaign in [michael_icon_church_province.GetName] has given rise to an unprecedented number of new recruits enlisting. The local clergy is convinced that this was the result of the widespread religious fervor that our icon of St. Michael has inspired. They report that young men have been coming from all parts of the area to see the icon of the Archistrategos and that they leave with a strong will to go to war in the name of their faith."

 orthodox_icon_events.4.t:0 "Christ Pantocrator"
 orthodox_icon_events.4.d:0 "As the ruler of all, Christ Pantocrator watches from above, in many of the church-domes around the country. Our veneration and extensive attention to this most central icon in any iconostasis also seem to have been the source of contemplation for many. Reminded of their own role in creation and of the rightful place of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] many are more content with both their own lives and with the government that rules them."

 orthodox_icon_events.5.d:0 "Our veneration of St. Nicholas seems to have made quite an impression on one of the merchants in a recent embassy from [benevolent_if_distant_neighbor.GetName]. The merchant was so impressed by the icon of St. Nicholas in [nicholas_icon_was_here.GetCapitalName], by the story of the saint, and by our devotion to Nicholas' legacy, that he decided to bestow three gifts. One gift will go to the cathedral where he saw the icon, one to the artist who created it and one to the benefactor who paid for it."
 orthodox_icon_events.5.a:0 "We must thank him on behalf of the church."

Indeed harvests seem more plentiful and the people more at peace and loyal than ever before.

Kava is a central part of most ceremonies all across the Polynesian Triangle, and it is a highly ritualized act which follows a strict set of rules and order. As the process of creation of this beverage is not set in stone, the results could vary a lot, leading to different outcomes. The last celebration we had with some important members of our own and neighboring societies was a total success due to the high quality Kava we served. Our fame as hosts has been greatly improved."

One would not think of this as a tool for death, but the human brain is very creative and using a sennit to strangle our ruler [Root.Monarch.GetName] was the option thought by the attacker."

Pigs are traditionally valued as they are not only delicious, but a big source of meat and owning several of them is a way to show power.

 shinto_events.14.a:0 "We must undercut these hornet nests."
 shinto_events.14.b:0 "Let us strive to work together with these armies of the faithful."
 shinto_events.14.c:0 "Authorize more temple towns to be built."
 shinto_events.15.t:0 "Social Tensions"
 shinto_events.15.d:0 "The Ikko-Ikki in our realm have been growing stronger, more numerous and above all bolder. Our officials report that sometimes an Ikki tax collector has collected already when they arrive in a village, and traders are no longer feeling safe as they pass these communities. The Ikko-Ikki are now so strong that many have started to question their privileges."
 shinto_events.15.b:0 "They cannot spread beyond their current borders."
 shinto_events.15.c:0 "This is only their right."
 shinto_events.15.a:0 "The time has come to crush these peasants!"
 shinto_events.16.t:0 "The End of Religious Self-Government"
 shinto_events.16.d:0 "We have finally managed to curtail the Ikko-Ikki, and towns under their command. The peasantry has been disarmed, and our deputies are now the only ones with authority to take up tolls, taxes and mount defenses against outsiders."
 shinto_events.16.a:0 "Order is Restored."
 shinto_events.17.t:0 "Parallel Authority"
 shinto_events.17.d:0 "The Ikko communities seem to be here to stay. While we have tried to safeguard our own authority we have also ceded considerable rights and privileges to the Jinaimachi, and it seems likely that they will continue to play a considerable role in our society."
 shinto_events.17.a:0 "Amitabhaya."
 shinto_events.18.t:0 "Support of the Ikko-Ikki"
 shinto_events.18.d:0 "We have continuously patronized the growth of temple communities and therefore we have come to be associated with the Ikko-Ikki. The leaders of the Buddhist temple communities may hold a lot of sway in our society, but they are also the ardent supporters of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 shinto_events.18.a:0 "Amitabhaya."
 shinto_events.19.t:0 "Moral Guidance in an Era of Turmoil"
 shinto_events.19.d:0 "Many of the leading Daimyo in Japan are either self-made men or depend on the loyalty of those who are. Our old moral codes, however, press the importance of lineage and loyalty and a social order based around the Imperial Court. Confucian scholars are now exploring the teachings of Chu Hsi for guidance in the governance of our country.\nThis newfound interest in Neo-Confucianism emphasizes the four books over the archaic classics and attempts to give a rational moral code for local rulers and ordinary men alike."
 shinto_events.19.a:0 "Let us patronize the institutions of the Imperial Court."
 shinto_events.19.b:0 "We should strive to attract the thinkers of this new strand of moral philosophy."
 shinto_events.20.t:0 "Birth and Privilege"
 shinto_events.20.d:0 "The spread of Neo-Confucian ideals in our society has led to a number of men of humble origins rising to positions of intellectual influence. One of the more prominent scholars of this age is himself the son of a Ronin, and along with other Confucian Scholars he is intent on making learning more widely available through public lectures and books written in simple language.\nIn many ways this is a challenge to the old social order, where learning was a privilege reserved for the families of the right lineages."
 shinto_events.20.a:0 "This is an initiative we must support."
 shinto_events.20.b:0 "We cannot allow social order to be threatened in this way!"
 shinto_events.21.t:0 "Meritocracy"
 shinto_events.21.d:0 "From a young age [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been studying Confucian texts and listening to Neo-Confucian Lectures. As the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of the [Root.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] now has the ability to put many of these philosophical principles to work. An ambitious scheme would be to root out those of little competence who hold influence in our realm solely on the basis of birth and the ancient ties of loyalty between our families.\nOf course our loyal vassals would likely see this as ingratitude and unwarranted hostility."
 shinto_events.21.a:0 "Merit should be the guiding principle."
 shinto_events.21.b:0 "We must support those loyal to us."
 shinto_events.22.t:0 "Neo-Confucian Administration"
 shinto_events.22.d:0 "We have sought a new rulership philosophy in the teachings of Chu Hsi and the Chinese traditions of Neo-Confucianism. Ideals that have proved to be a solid foundation, not only for our bureaucracy, but for our society at large. Rational thought, more widespread literacy and a clearer focus on merit over birth has allowed the [Root.GetAdjective] to build a stronger state in an era of upheaval."
 shinto_events.22.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.23.t:0 "Times are Changing"
 shinto_events.23.d:0 "While the main strand of philosophy was once the transition from Traditional Japanese values to the more rationalist approach of the Chinese, the focus of philosophers and scholars have now moved on to individual responsibility. Too much focus on intellect disregards the actual feelings of love and empathy which are the foundations of a functioning society.\nThe interpretations and discussions of the Analects will likely continue. As they do, however, a much larger segment of society can partake due to the now widespread literacy and familiarity with the Classics and Books."
 shinto_events.23.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.24.t:0 "Traditionalist Administration"
 shinto_events.24.d:0 "While we have listened to new interpretations of Confucian scholars such as Chu Hsi we have not lost focus on the ancient traditions of our people. We have proven that we still value the Imperial Court and the ancient system of titles and loyalties that our ancestors maintained."
 shinto_events.24.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.25.t:0 "Arrival of European Traders"
 shinto_events.25.d:0 "With the arrival of ships from the west we are seeing an influx of highly sought after goods, not only from Europe but also from the various corners of Asia that western traders frequent. Great ships are becoming an increasingly common sight along our coastlines and, for the Daimyo that welcome them, they promise great riches.\nThe captain of such a ship recently arrived in [nanban_traders_here.GetName], asking that we allow them to dock periodically in a nearby harbor to market western goods."
 shinto_events.25.a:0 "Encourage them to make it a permanent stop."
 shinto_events.25.b:0 "We will enforce strict rules for whom they can meet or do business with."
 shinto_events.25.c:0 "We will accept their goods but offer no guarantees in the future."
 shinto_events.26.t:0 "Duplicity among European Traders"
 shinto_events.26.d:0 "Ever since the arrival of the westerners some have regarded them with distrust. Their pockets are deep, their weapons powerful and, to some, their culture seems fascinating. Those that deal with these traders, however, report that the Europeans are constantly plotting against each other. Scarcely a meeting with foreign emissaries goes by in which they do not warn us of some plot or scheme by their adversaries. It is clear we are not dealing with men of honor.\nAs a new group of traders requests that we increase their privileges our advisors caution us to consider the offer carefully."
 shinto_events.26.a:0 "We will allow them to expand their presence."
 shinto_events.26.b:0 "Limit their influence to a few more ports."
 shinto_events.26.c:0 "Their business must be kept limited to [nanban_traders_here.GetCapitalName]."
 shinto_events.27.t:0 "Rangaku"
 shinto_events.27.d:0 "The trade post in [nanban_traders_here.GetName] has started to attract not only merchants but also scholars and intellectuals. To these men the books that the foreigners bring are far more valuable than the goods they wish to sell. The study of western science and culture, Rangaku, is growing into its own discipline, and according to the adherents we have much to learn. Many clerics are skeptical, however, as are some Confucian scholars."
 shinto_events.27.a:0 "We must do our best to encourage dissemination of western science."
 shinto_events.27.b:0 "Their business must be kept limited to [nanban_traders_here.GetCapitalName]."
 shinto_events.28.t:0 "Foreign Influence"
 shinto_events.28.d:0 "Some argue that we are making ourselves too dependent on the foreign traders. Our own artisans are surely no less gifted than those abroad, and instead of spending a fortune importing manufactured goods from the outside world we might produce many of them. We could then profit from their resale, ourselves.\nThe time is not right to stop the trade entirely, but if we put our greatest craftsmen at work we may in time no longer need to await the arrival of the next trade ship quite so anxiously."
 shinto_events.28.a:0 "An excellent investment!"
 shinto_events.28.b:0 "There is no need to attempt what others do better."
 shinto_events.29.t:0 "Kaikoku?"
 shinto_events.29.d:0 "The meeting with the west has been quite a tumultuous encounter, and especially so for the [Root.GetAdjective]! Our efforts to welcome the western traders have brought us an unparalleled insight into European culture and good access to their goods. Enterprising Kokujin and other influentials have begun sending their sons to Europe to study the westerners first hand, trying to uncover as much as possible that we could make use of at home."
 shinto_events.29.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.30.t:0 "Trade with the West"
 shinto_events.30.d:0 "Over time the earnings from trade with the west have decreased from its initial high, but the influx of goods and ideas from these far-away travelers are still changing our society from what it once was. Only time will tell to what extent we might assimilate the ideals of these far-away travelers."
 shinto_events.30.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.31.t:0 "Sakoku?"
 shinto_events.31.d:0 "We have acted forcefully to limit the influence of Western Traders on our society. While trying to cut all contacts off entirely would likely result in smuggling we have restricted the traders to a single port, and we heavily regulate their interaction with the world outside of that point of contact. This way we can partake in what goods (and guns) we wish to acquire while limiting the risks of subversive religious attempts or plotting."
 shinto_events.31.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.32.t:0 "Firearms"
 shinto_events.32.d:0 "With the arrival of western traders the first portable firearms have come to our realm. These weapons are unlike the ones used here, and they promise to revolutionize warfare should they become widespread. Acquiring enough of them is not as straightforward as it might seem, however. The muskets are in great demand among those that have seen their power, but the prospect of what they could do in the hands of our enemies, or even an unruly peasant community, is also quite disturbing.\nAs we start to produce and instruct our soldiers in the use of these arms we will need to decide who will have access to these guns and how many we will make."
 shinto_events.32.a:0 "Strength in numbers! Produce as many as we can."
 shinto_events.32.b:0 "We will make just enough for a small force of trusted men."
 shinto_events.33.t:0 "Dissemination of Firearms"
 shinto_events.33.d:0 "The flintlock muskets brought to us by the foreigners have proven easier to mass produce than we could have hoped. As more and more of our troops can be equipped with these guns it is clear that we will not be able to limit their spread to either our enemies or the common man very effectively. If we really do wish to decrease the firearms in circulation we will have to take very firm action soon."
 shinto_events.33.a:0 "Doing so would only weaken our armies."
 shinto_events.33.b:0 "Ban the use of guns entirely for commoners."
 shinto_events.34.t:0 "Evolution of Arms"
 shinto_events.34.d:0 "With the novelty of firearms wearing off, it has become clear that they are not as efficient as their early proponents claimed. Through training, we might surely increase their efficiency, and some of our smiths have also suggested ways to improve the weapons themselves. Others would argue that we should spend the time of both our smiths and our soldiers on more traditional arms. The weapons of our ancestors still seem most influential in battles, and we would perhaps do well to honor their traditions."
 shinto_events.34.a:0 "We need better guns!"
 shinto_events.34.b:0 "The Sword is mightier than the musket."
 shinto_events.35.t:0 "A Military Revolution"
 shinto_events.35.d:0 "Since the first matchlocks started appearing in our lands they have gone from being a novelty to one of the more common weapons in use. Some even claim we make more and better weapons than their originating countries do. This has placed a dangerous weapon in the hands of anyone who would oppose our rule, but the rapid adoption of the guns has also made our armies a more respected force than many others."
 shinto_events.35.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.36.t:0 "The Musket - A Weapon and a Tool"
 shinto_events.36.d:0 "Since the first matchlocks started appearing in our lands they have gone from being a novelty to one of the more common weapons in use. As the novelty has worn off and other rulers have adopted them, these arms are no longer heralded as a revolution on the battlefield, but they remain with regiments that specialize in their use.\nIn civilian life it has also become customary to use muskets for guards and hunters."
 shinto_events.36.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.37.t:0 "The Power of the Sword"
 shinto_events.37.d:0 "Rather than devote all our energy to the use and spread of firearms we have tried to limit them, and instead encourage the use of sword and spear. Muskets may in time become more commonplace, but for now we still believe that these, classical weapons will bring glory and honor to our realm."
 shinto_events.37.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.38.t:0 "Dainichi?"
 shinto_events.38.d:0 "With the arrival of Europeans we have come into contact with a new culture and a new religion. In some ways it seems similar to ours, but in others it is completely alien to us. A group of men has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], trying to preach the gospel of a Kirishitan god. Their message appears to be very odd, however, likely due to incompetent or ill-willed translators.\nIn their eagerness to secure the patronage of [Root.Monarch.GetName] the missionaries have appeared bearing no gifts and spouting nonsense. This is a grave disrespect to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], yet some would caution that these blunders mean that they are in desperate need of our help."
 shinto_events.38.a:0 "Preposterous! They have no place here!"
 shinto_events.38.b:0 "We will allow them to stay as long as they behave."
 shinto_events.38.c:0 "Let us hear what their God can teach us."
 shinto_events.39.t:0 "Missions in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]"
 shinto_events.39.da:0 "A group of the Kirishitan have arrived at court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] today, asking that they be allowed to create a small community of faithful in our great city. They would then see to the poor and teach those who would listen about their god.\nThe Missionaries also offer to tutor our own [Root.Heir.GetName] in the ways of God, as well as the disciplines of Christian science. The Buddhist clergy, as well as some of our Kokujin, are cautioning us, as they feel this is an affront to our ancient traditions while the traders in our realm hope to secure valuable trade deals with the westerners if we let them stay."
 shinto_events.39.db:0 "A group of the Kirishitan have arrived at court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] today, asking that they be allowed to create a small community of faithful in our great city.

 shinto_events.39.a:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] will be happy to learn of their god."
 shinto_events.39.b:0 "We can allow them to spread their faith here."
 shinto_events.39.c:0 "We must defend the faith of our ancestors!"
 shinto_events.40.t:0 "Trade Privileges"
 shinto_events.40.d:0 "A group of Christian missionaries have approached [Root.Monarch.GetName] with an offer to divert the great trade ships of their homeland to our ports, if we allow them to create a seaside community for Christian converts. This is an offer that carries considerable worth to our merchants."
 shinto_events.40.a:0 "Let them come!"
 shinto_events.40.b:0 "We cannot allow this."
 shinto_events.41.t:0 "Letter of Recommendation"
 shinto_events.41.d:0 "The Christian missions in our land have behaved well since they came to settle here. They respect the laws and an increasing number of men and women have begun to see the light of their god. Their leader has gained a reputation as an excellent mediator and would likely make a fine minister. He has agreed to this on the condition that we write a letter of recommendation to the other worldly leaders of Japan.\nOf course, our more traditionalist vassals would see his appointment as an offense both to tradition and to themselves. Their self-proclaimed leader would also likely want to take up office, though his talents lie in other areas."
 shinto_events.41.a:0 "Write a letter."
 shinto_events.41.b:0 "We cannot do that."
 shinto_events.42.t:0 "Christianity on Trial"
 shinto_events.42.d:0 "We have been approached by a great number of our most valued Kokujin as well as dignitaries of the temple communities in our lands. They all demand that we look into the subversive qualities of Christianity. They feel this alien religion is destroying our traditions and insulting our ancestors, and they demand that we put the faith on trial, allowing trusted men of honor and quality to look into this."
 shinto_events.42.a:0 "An inquisition they will have, then."
 shinto_events.42.a.tt:0 "Results may vary depending on what the inquisition finds."
 shinto_events.42.b:0 "It is not their place. Mind cannot reason over faith."
 shinto_events.42.b.tt:0 "This will have no direct effect on the outcome of this incident."
 shinto_events.43.t:0 "The Nature of God"
 shinto_events.43.d:0 "The inquisition into the nature of Christianity has taken a most shocking turn, as the judges themselves have returned demanding to be baptized. One is a learned and respected neo-Confucian scholar, another a respected astronomer, and the last one of our most honorable Samurai retainers. As these men were selected as pillars of society this is an unexpected development to us all."
 shinto_events.43.a:0 "We shall have to allow it, then."
 shinto_events.43.b:0 "Preposterous! We must follow the advice of our Kokujin!"
 shinto_events.44.t:0 "Christianity Derided"
 shinto_events.44.d:0 "The inquisition of the nature of Christianity has, not surprisingly, resulted in the religion being found lacking in terms of respect and adherence to the traditions of our culture. The learned and honorable men we put in charge of the investigation have declared that while the religion may seem tempting, it is in reality a danger to our society."
 shinto_events.44.a:0 "This is the land of the Gods!"
 shinto_events.44.b:0 "While we respect their judgment the Christians must stay."
 shinto_events.45.t:0 "Christian Community Attacked"
 shinto_events.45.d:0 "The warehouses of the Christian merchants in [christian_port_event_target.GetName] have caught fire more than once this month, and while the local Samurai claim that this has been a series of unfortunate accidents it seems clear not everyone is as favorably inclined as we are to the arrival of the gaijin on our shores."
 shinto_events.45.a:0 "Conduct an investigation to punish the perpetrators."
 shinto_events.45.b:0 "There is little we can do about accidents."
 shinto_events.46.t:0 "A Break with Tradition?"
 shinto_events.46.d:0 "It is no secret that [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] line have become personally involved with the Christian faith. Over time Christianity has come to overtake the Shinto, Buddhist and Confucian traditions of Japan, and it is the guiding ideology for our state. Now that Japan is a more united and ordered society, perhaps the time has come to complete the transition and adopt Christianity as the religion of our state?"
 shinto_events.46.a:0 "No, we could never turn our back on tradition entirely!"
 shinto_events.46.b:0 "The time has come for change."
 shinto_events.47.t:0 "A Kirishitan Realm"
 shinto_events.47.d:0 "We have taken the followers of the Christian god under our wing and have allowed them the protection of our state. Wherever they go in our realm, everyone knows that these Christians have the right to live, work and proselytize. Christian merchants are a common sight in our cities, and at court it has become an increasingly common religion among our ministers and retainers."
 shinto_events.47.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.48.t:0 "Significant Christian Presence"
 shinto_events.48.d:0 "While we have kept them under watch we have allowed Christian communities to grow in our lands, while protecting their followers from harm. This has allowed us to secure valuable trade deals with their oversea homeland, and has earned us a reputation as a just and fair realm."
 shinto_events.48.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.49.t:0 "Christianity Defeated"
 shinto_events.49.d:0 "We have managed to subvert the dangerous influences of Christianity in our society. We have kept their missionaries at arm's length and closed our realm to their followers, going as far as tracking down any suspected adherents within our borders. As a result we are lauded by both our retainers and the Shinto and Buddhist clergy in our realm as the defender of the way of our ancestors."
 shinto_events.49.a:0 "Ok."
 shinto_events.50.t:0 "The [Root.Overlord.GetName] Shogunate"
 shinto_events.50.d:0 "In an attempt to increase [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetHerHis] authority over the Daimyo of Japan, [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetName] has been conducting nation-wide cadastral surveys. This involves measuring and counting all people, resources and ownership relations, and refashioning them according to [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetHerHis] design. It is a task given by the Emperor to our Shogun, but it is being used to turn long-standing relationships of power on their heads.\nToday the time for such a survey has come for the [Root.GetName] realm. We have been approached by the administrators of the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] administration with a proclamation stating that fiefs granted to vassals ultimately belong to the state, and that vassals hold land in trust for the present time only."
 shinto_events.50.a:0 "Nobody will touch my right to collect tax!"
 shinto_events.50.b:0 "Offer to perform such a count and present the result to [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetName]."
 shinto_events.50.c:0 "Welcome the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] administrators."
 shinto_events.51.t:0 "The Question of Residence"
 shinto_events.51.d:0 "The Shogun has sent word that the Emperor requires our presence near the Imperial Court. Residing in our own court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] will no longer be acceptable all year, and it has been decreed that our family must instead from now on reside in the Imperial Court all year. While this has at times already been the case, this imperial order leaves little room for us to decide for ourselves. [Root.Monarch.GetName] must travel to the court at once or face dire consequences."
 shinto_events.51.a:0 "By all means let us do so."
 shinto_events.51.b:0 "The [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] are weak and weak willed."
 shinto_events.52.t:0 "Appointment to Imperial Office"
 shinto_events.52.d:0 "The Bakufu has sent word that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is expected to serve as an Imperial official. Given the sincerity of the request a refusal would be out of the question, and could even be seen as a sign of outright rebellion and dishonor. It is also clearly a way to achieve prestige and influence for the [Root.GetAdjective], but it is a dangerous honor. The [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] Shogunate has lately been going through officials at an alarming rate. Not content to allow their supporters and loyal retainers to hold high office, they are now dismissing those that do not deliver the results that the Shogun expects. To some this is a system of merit, but to the many officials in Imperial service it means a constant fear of scrutiny."
 shinto_events.52.a:0 "We must serve the Shogun and the Emperor."
 shinto_events.52.b:0 "We cannot partake in this charade, refuse the appointment."
 shinto_events.52.b.tt:0 "[Root.Overlord.GetName] may declare war on [Root.GetName]."
 shinto_events.53.t:0 "The Daimyo of [From.GetName] Refuses to Serve!"
 shinto_events.53.d:0 "Our vassal, the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of the [From.GetAdjective] has refused an Imperial summons to serve as an official in our administration. A weak excuse was offered, but this is a clear challenge to our authority."
 shinto_events.53.a:0 "We will have to find someone else then."
 shinto_events.53.b:0 "This will not stand, we must punish the [From.GetAdjective]!"
 shinto_events.54.t:0 "The [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] Back Down"
 shinto_events.54.d:0 "Proving [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] to be as weak as we suspected, the [Root.Overlord.GetName] Shogun has agreed to back down from the demand of service. They have sent the order to fill the position we refused to someone else, but their authority is severely weakened as anyone could see the effect of our refusal."
 shinto_events.54.a:0 "Let their weakness be apparent to all!"
 shinto_events.55.t:0 "Adherence to the Bakufu"
 shinto_events.55.d:0 "Our policy of loyalty and acquiescence as the Shogunate strengthens its grip over Japan has earned us the trust and loyalty of the Imperial court. We may have given up independence in the eyes of some, but we have also gained valuable favors and a place among the ruling families of a new Japan."
 shinto_events.55.a:0 "We remain the loyal servants of the Son of Heaven."
 shinto_events.56.t:0 "Growing Power of the Shogunate"
 shinto_events.56.d:0 "We have tried to steer a middle route as the Shogunate attempts to strengthen its grip over the Empire. While we are not counted among the most disloyal vassals of the Emperor, we are also not part of the group closest to the administration. This has allowed us to preserve our independence while also benefitting from the law, order and safety that the new times bring."
 shinto_events.56.a:0 "We will continue to preserve our room for maneuver."
 shinto_events.57.t:0 "Fragmentation of Shogunate Power"
 shinto_events.57.d:0 "Our policy of actively asserting our independence and relying on alternative local authority rather than playing along with the machinations of the Shogunate has earned us a reputation as a fiercely independent and powerful Daimyo. Our word carries respect, and our actions resonate with many of the Daimyo and Kokujin in Japan who wish to push the limit of their vassalage. By actively undermining Imperial authority we are quickly building a power base of our own."
 shinto_events.57.a:0 "Actions speak louder than words."
 shinto_events.58.t:0 "The Amida Buddha"
 shinto_events.58.d:1 "Our long-standing support of the Ikko-Ikki has not been without friction and in many situations it is as if there are two parallel authorities in Japan. Still, the Ikko-Ikki would arguably not have come as far as they have without our protection according to many.\nWith times of civil strife behind us many expect us to elevate the leaders of the Ikko-Ikki to high positions and make their faith more officially sponsored by the state. To many this would be a grave insult to our old traditions, however..."
 shinto_events.58.a:0 "No, we cannot turn our back on the traditions of our ancestors entirely."
 shinto_events.58.b:1 "Amitabhaya. We must embrace their beliefs and enshrine them into our legal system."
 shinto_events.58.c:1 "Amitabhaya. Their communes shall be given full authority."
 shinto_events.58.e:1 "Amitabhaya. Their philosophy is sound, but we cannot allow them to rule."
